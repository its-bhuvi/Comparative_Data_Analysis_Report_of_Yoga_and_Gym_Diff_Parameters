# Comparative Data Analysis of Yoga and Gym for Different NCD Parameters
## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis comparing the effects of Yoga and Gym activities on various Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) parameters, specifically focusing on Diabetes, Obesity, and Hypertension. The goal is to derive insights that can inform better health and fitness decisions.

## Key Responsibilities

## 1. Data Collection:

Collected data on Yoga and Gym activities, including frequency, duration, intensity, and types of exercises.
Gathered health-related data, including vital signs, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and specific parameters related to Diabetes, Obesity, and Hypertension.

## 2. Data Analysis:

Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Used statistical methods and data visualization tools to analyze the impact of Yoga and Gym on NCD parameters.
Identified trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to draw meaningful insights.

## 3. Insights and Recommendations:

Compared the effectiveness of Yoga and Gym activities on improving Diabetes, Obesity, and Hypertension metrics.
Provided data-driven recommendations on which exercise regimen might be more beneficial for managing these specific NCD parameters.
Highlighted key findings and presented them in a detailed report.

## 4. Technologies Used
Data Analysis Tools: Python, Excel
Visualization Tools: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statistical Methods: Correlation analysis, regression analysis, hypothesis testing

## 5. Key Outcomes
Identified specific Yoga poses and Gym exercises that were particularly effective in improving Diabetes, Obesity, and Hypertension.
Provided actionable insights that helped the individual make informed decisions about their fitness routine.
Demonstrated the potential benefits of personalized exercise programs based on data analysis.

## 6. Files Included
